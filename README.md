# TELECOM CUSTOMER CHURN ANALYSIS & PREDICTION REPORT

### PROBLEM STATEMENT

#### SUMMARY

To monitor, analyze, and predict customer churn trends in the telecom sector, this project aims to create a comprehensive Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction Report. The report provides insights into key churn drivers, customer demographics, usage behavior, and predictive churn modeling. The goal is to enable data-driven retention strategies and improve customer lifetime value by identifying high-risk segments and underlying causes of churn.

##### Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s) Requirements

General Churn KPIs:
	•	Total Customers: Count of all customers in the data set to assess overall base.
	•	Total Churned Customers: Count of customers who have churned.
	•	Churn Rate: Ratio of churned customers to total customers.
	•	New Joiners: Count of newly acquired customers.

Demographic & Behavioral KPI’s:
	•	Churn Rate by Gender
	•	Churn Rate by State
	•	Churn Rate by Contract Type
	•	Churn Rate by Age Group
	•	Churn Rate by Tenure Group
	•	Monthly Charge Range Impact on Churn

Predictive KPI’s:
	•	Count of Predicted Churners (using ML model)
	•	Top Factors influencing Churn (Feature Importance)


##### OVERVIEW

In our Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction project, we aim to present key churn-related metrics and predictive insights through visual dashboards and machine learning models. The visualizations will empower business stakeholders to understand churn patterns, evaluate risk segments, and implement targeted retention strategies.

#### DETAILS

##### Objective

To deliver an intuitive Customer Churn Dashboard and ML-powered churn prediction pipeline that allows users to:
• Monitor overall churn metrics.
• Drill down by key demographics and service categories.
• Identify geographic hotspots of churn.
• Predict future churners using machine learning (Random Forest Classifier).
• Understand key factors driving churn through feature importance.

This dashboard will serve as a single point of reference for marketing teams, retention managers, and executive stakeholders to monitor churn performance and design customer retention strategies.

Tools & Techniques Will be used
• Data Engineering: SQL (Data Cleaning, Transformation, Null Handling)
• Data Modeling & Visualization: Power BI (Power Query transformations, DAX measures, interactive dashboards)
• Machine Learning: Python (Random Forest Classifier for Churn Prediction, Feature Importance extraction)
